# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "INSERT TITLE HERE".
This is my first blog post.

# Instructions {#sec-instructions}

In this assignment, you will be creating your "Welcome to my Blog" post by editing the contents of this document.
This document is written in Quarto.
Here are the course's [Quarto instructions](https://isaactpetersen.github.io/QuartoBlogFantasyFootball/posts/quarto-instructions/).
However, for this post, you will not need to create a new folder/post from a template (which you will do for future posts)â€”in this assignment, you will merely edit and re-post this current post.

To follow the instructions (below), you must first create a new GitHub repository using the "QuartoBlogFantasyFootball" repository as a template (per the instructions [here](https://isaactpetersen.github.io/Fantasy-Football-Analytics-Textbook/getting-started.html#sec-initialSetup)).
Then, you will edit the `index.qmd` file associated with this post in the following location: `./posts/welcome/index.qmd`.
Edit the `index.qmd` file according to the instructions below:

- In the header (above; currently `author: "Insert D. Name"`), change the author name to your full name and change the date (currently `date: "9/2/2025"`).
- Change the post image.
To do this, you'll need to add the image file to the same folder as this document and update the file name above (currently `image: "thumbnail.jpg"`).
- Insert headers for the following sections (I aleady created a header for the first section for you):
    - "Welcome to my Blog!"
    - "About Me"
    - "About This Blog"
- Add the info described below to the relevant section:
    - Insert a blog title.
    - Introduce yourself and tell the readers about yourself (nothing you don't feel comfortable sharing).
    - Say what your blog articles will be about (generally) and why you are excited to write about that.
    - Say something about the unique perspective you will bring to writing about that topic.
- Remove this "Instructions" section (and the notes below) when you post your article.
- To post your article, follow the course's [Quarto instructions](https://isaactpetersen.github.io/QuartoBlogFantasyFootball/posts/quarto-instructions/) to first render it locally, and, if everything looks the way you want it to, push it to GitHub so the article goes live (assuming it renders successfully in GitHub Actions)!
- If you have difficulty, consult the course's [Quarto instructions](https://isaactpetersen.github.io/QuartoBlogFantasyFootball/posts/quarto-instructions/).
- When submitting, make sure to follow the assignment instructions and rubric on ICON, and to submit both (1) the URL to the live post and (2) a PDF of the post.

- This is a **public** blog.
The whole world can see it.
This can increase the visibility of your work and profile.
You can expect that anything you write online is **permanent**.
My strong suggestion is: <u>Don't write anything that you wouldn't feel comfortable with your parents or (current or) future employer seeing.</u>
- The writing should be your own!
- For all graphics, you should either a) create them yourself or b) use only those graphics that you have the license to use.
You can use graphics with a Creative Commons license as long as you follow the terms of the license (e.g., cite the original, indicate if you make any changes, etc).
To find graphics that have a Creative Commons license, when using Google Image Search, select: "Tools" > "Usage Rights" > "Creative Commons Licenses".
