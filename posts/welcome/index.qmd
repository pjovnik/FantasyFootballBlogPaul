# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "Paul's First Fantasy Football Blog".
This is my first blog post. 

# About Me {#sec-aboutme}

Hello readers, my name is Paul! I'm from La Grange, IL studying Psychology at the University of Iowa! In my free time, I love playing golf, hanging out with friends, and attending Chicago Cubs games! My favorite football team is the Chicago Bears and I've been playing fantasy football since about seventh grade. I can't wait to write more about statistics relating to fantasy football to help you and me draft better teams and win more championships!

# About This Blog {#sec-aboutthisblog}

Wiht my knowledge about fantasy football and knack for math, I feel like I can help readers understand the statistics behind some of the many factors in fantasy football to help you build a championship roster with precise statistical measurements and proper techniques to make sure that you are drafting and acquiring the right players!
