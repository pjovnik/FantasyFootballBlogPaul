I’m from La Grange, IL studying Psychology at the University of Iowa! In my free time, I love playing golf, hanging out with friends, and attending Chicago Cubs games! My favorite football team is the Chicago Bears and I’ve been playing fantasy football since about seventh grade. I can’t wait to write more about statistics relating to fantasy football to help you and me draft better teams and win more championships!\n\n\n3 About This Blog\nWith my knowledge about fantasy football and knack for math, I feel like I can help readers understand the statistics behind some of the many factors in fantasy football to help you build a championship roster with precise statistical measurements and proper techniques to make sure that you are drafting and acquiring the right players!"

It is better to do your own research and decide who has the best chances of creating the most upside that week.\n\n\nCode\nsessionInfo()\n\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.26.so;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C           LC_TIME=C.UTF-8       \n [4] LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=C.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=C.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=C.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C              LC_ADDRESS=C          \n[10] LC_TELEPHONE=C         LC_MEASUREMENT=C.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C   \n\ntime zone: UTC\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] nflreadr_1.5.0    lubridate_1.9.4   forcats_1.0.1     stringr_1.6.0    \n [5] dplyr_1.1.4       purrr_1.2.0       readr_2.1.6       tidyr_1.3.1      \n [9] tibble_3.3.0      tidyverse_2.0.0   ggridges_0.5.7    GGally_2.4.0     \n[13] ggplot2_4.0.1     DescTools_0.99.60 psych_2.5.6       petersenlab_1.2.1\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] Rdpack_2.6.4       DBI_1.2.3          mnormt_2.1.1       gridExtra_2.3     \n [5] gld_2.6.8          readxl_1.4.5       rlang_1.1.6        magrittr_2.0.4    \n [9] e1071_1.7-16       compiler_4.5.2     mgcv_1.9-3         vctrs_0.6.5       \n[13] reshape2_1.4.5     quadprog_1.5-8     pkgconfig_2.0.3    fastmap_1.2.0     \n[17] backports_1.5.0    labeling_0.4.3     pbivnorm_0.6.0     rmarkdown_2.30    \n[21] tzdb_0.5.0         haven_2.5.5        nloptr_2.2.1       xfun_0.54         \n[25] cachem_1.1.0       jsonlite_2.0.0     parallel_4.5.2     lavaan_0.6-20     \n[29] cluster_2.1.8.1    R6_2.6.1           stringi_1.8.7      RColorBrewer_1.1-3\n[33] boot_1.3-32        rpart_4.1.24       cellranger_1.1.0   Rcpp_1.1.0        \n[37] knitr_1.50         base64enc_0.1-3    Matrix_1.7-4       splines_4.5.2     \n[41] nnet_7.3-20        timechange_0.3.0   tidyselect_1.2.1   rstudioapi_0.17.1 \n[45] yaml_2.3.10        lattice_0.22-7     plyr_1.8.9         withr_3.0.2       \n[49] S7_0.2.1           evaluate_1.0.5     foreign_0.8-90     ggstats_0.11.0    \n[53] proxy_0.4-27       pillar_1.11.1      checkmate_2.3.3    stats4_4.5.2      \n[57] reformulas_0.4.2   generics_0.1.4     mix_1.0-13         hms_1.1.4         \n[61] scales_1.4.0       rootSolve_1.8.2.4  minqa_1.2.8        xtable_1.8-4      \n[65] class_7.3-23       glue_1.8.0         Hmisc_5.2-4        lmom_3.2          \n[69] tools_4.5.2        data.table_1.17.8  lme4_1.1-37        Exact_3.3         \n[73] fs_1.6.6           mvtnorm_1.3-3      grid_4.5.2         mitools_2.4       \n[77] rbibutils_2.4      colorspace_2.1-2   nlme_3.1-168       htmlTable_2.4.3   \n[81] Formula_1.2-5      cli_3.6.5          expm_1.0-0         viridisLite_0.4.2 \n[85] gtable_0.3.6       digest_0.6.39      htmlwidgets_1.6.4  farver_2.1.2      \n[89] memoise_2.0.1      htmltools_0.5.8.1  lifecycle_1.0.4    httr_1.4.7        \n[93] MASS_7.3-65"

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Team Members\nplayers &lt;- data.frame( ID = 1:14, name = c( “Joe Burrow”, “Trey McBride”, “Derrick Henry”, “Patrick Mahomes”, “Garrett Wilson”, “De’Von Achane”, “Drake London”, “Jaxon Smith-Njigba”, “Tyler Warren”, “TreyVeyon Henderson”, “Jonathan Taylor”, “Nico Collins”, “Brandon Aubrey”, “Steelers” ), position = c( “QB”, “TE”, “RB”, “QB”, “WR”, “RB”, “WR”, “WR”, “TE”, “RB”, “RB”, “WR”, “K”, “D” )\n\n\n2 Justification\nI decided to draft with an RB-heavy approach, drafting Derrick Henry and De’Von Achane early into my draft. I also loaded up with wide receivers who are young but have been stellar and proven early into their careers, such as Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Drake London. I had the opportunity to draft Ja’Marr Chase, so I decided to pair him with his LSU teammate Joe Burrow. I also decided to draft some highly-regarded rookies, Tyler Warren and TreyVeyon Henderson who have high floors in PPR Fantasy. Rounding out, Patrick Mahomes is an NFL MVP and super bowl champion, as well as Trey McBride who has taken major strides and has established himself as a premier tight end in the NFL over the past couple years, despite a lack of touchdowns scored.\n\n\n3 Team Strengths\nI think that the biggest strongsuits of my team include my wide recievers and running backs. Derrick Henry has finished as a top 10 fantasy running back in 7 of his last 8 fantasy seasons, as well as Jonathan Taylor having many seasons as a top 12 back, excluding unhealthier seasons. My wide reciever corps are fantasy stalwarts, as Ja’Marr Chase had an ADP of 1:1 this season due to monster fantasy performances throughout his short career so far. While Drake London, Garrett Wilson, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have some questionable quarterbacks, their performaces have been nothing short of great, all averaging 100 recieving yards and over 1000 yards.\n\n\n4 Team Weaknesses\nWhile my team has some great position players, I feel as if my defense and Quarterbacks have some concerns. Mahomes and Burrow aren’t exactly mobile quarterbacks, which matters heavily in fantasy leagues. The ability to get rushing yards and touchdowns from your quarterbacks can turn your team from a middle of the pack team to a true league powerhouse. While Burrow and Mahomes can sling the pill, they are not established rushing quarterbacks whatsoever. As for my defense, the Steelers are known historically for their great defenses, their performance against the New York Jets has me questioning their fantasy value.\n\n\n5 Team Plan\nMy current plan is to stick with my guys, as I feel like I can be a league winner with this roster. If need be, I will search the waivers for a more mobile quarterback and possibly a better defense.\n\n\n6 Prediction\nWhile NFL Fantasy predicts me to have a 13-1 season, I think thats a little out of reach. I think that I have drafted a team with many strengths and very nit-picky weaknesses. I believe that this roster can win a fantasy championship, however will come with close games and losses throughout the season, as the league is very deep. I predict that I will finish with a 9-4 record."

High snap counts lead to high fantasy scores, while week in and week out inconsistencies and “trusting your gut” can ultimately cost you in the long run. While players can go on high point streaks, consistency is what matters in the end. Don’t fall for streaky waiver wire players, and trade for players who can make consistent impacts!\n\n\nCode\nsessionInfo()\n\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.26.so;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C           LC_TIME=C.UTF-8       \n [4] LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=C.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=C.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=C.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C              LC_ADDRESS=C          \n[10] LC_TELEPHONE=C         LC_MEASUREMENT=C.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C   \n\ntime zone: UTC\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] nflreadr_1.5.0    lubridate_1.9.4   forcats_1.0.1     stringr_1.6.0    \n [5] dplyr_1.1.4       purrr_1.2.0       readr_2.1.6       tidyr_1.3.1      \n [9] tibble_3.3.0      tidyverse_2.0.0   ggridges_0.5.7    GGally_2.4.0     \n[13] ggplot2_4.0.1     effectsize_1.0.1  correlation_0.8.8 DescTools_0.99.60\n[17] psych_2.5.6       XICOR_0.4.1       petersenlab_1.2.1\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n  [1] Rdpack_2.6.4        DBI_1.2.3           mnormt_2.1.1       \n  [4] gridExtra_2.3       gld_2.6.8           sandwich_3.1-1     \n  [7] readxl_1.4.5        rlang_1.1.6         magrittr_2.0.4     \n [10] multcomp_1.4-29     e1071_1.7-16        compiler_4.5.2     \n [13] mgcv_1.9-3          vctrs_0.6.5         reshape2_1.4.5     \n [16] quadprog_1.5-8      pkgconfig_2.0.3     fastmap_1.2.0      \n [19] backports_1.5.0     labeling_0.4.3      pbivnorm_0.6.0     \n [22] rmarkdown_2.30      psychTools_2.5.7.22 tzdb_0.5.0         \n [25] haven_2.5.5         nloptr_2.2.1        xfun_0.54          \n [28] cachem_1.1.0        jsonlite_2.0.0      parallel_4.5.2     \n [31] lavaan_0.6-20       cluster_2.1.8.1     R6_2.6.1           \n [34] stringi_1.8.7       RColorBrewer_1.1-3  boot_1.3-32        \n [37] rpart_4.1.24        estimability_1.5.1  cellranger_1.1.0   \n [40] Rcpp_1.1.0          knitr_1.50          zoo_1.8-14         \n [43] parameters_0.28.2   base64enc_0.1-3     timechange_0.3.0   \n [46] Matrix_1.7-4        splines_4.5.2       nnet_7.3-20        \n [49] tidyselect_1.2.1    rstudioapi_0.17.1   yaml_2.3.10        \n [52] codetools_0.2-20    lattice_0.22-7      plyr_1.8.9         \n [55] withr_3.0.2         bayestestR_0.17.0   S7_0.2.1           \n [58] coda_0.19-4.1       evaluate_1.0.5      foreign_0.8-90     \n [61] survival_3.8-3      ggstats_0.11.0      proxy_0.4-27       \n [64] pillar_1.11.1       checkmate_2.3.3     rtf_0.4-14.1       \n [67] stats4_4.5.2        reformulas_0.4.2    insight_1.4.2      \n [70] plotly_4.11.0       generics_0.1.4      mix_1.0-13         \n [73] hms_1.1.4           scales_1.4.0        rootSolve_1.8.2.4  \n [76] minqa_1.2.8         xtable_1.8-4        class_7.3-23       \n [79] glue_1.8.0          lazyeval_0.2.2      emmeans_2.0.0      \n [82] Hmisc_5.2-4         lmom_3.2            tools_4.5.2        \n [85] data.table_1.17.8   lme4_1.1-37         Exact_3.3          \n [88] fs_1.6.6            mvtnorm_1.3-3       grid_4.5.2         \n [91] mitools_2.4         crosstalk_1.2.2     rbibutils_2.4      \n [94] datawizard_1.3.0    colorspace_2.1-2    nlme_3.1-168       \n [97] htmlTable_2.4.3     Formula_1.2-5       cli_3.6.5          \n[100] expm_1.0-0          viridisLite_0.4.2   gtable_0.3.6       \n[103] R.methodsS3_1.8.2   digest_0.6.39       TH.data_1.1-5      \n[106] htmlwidgets_1.6.4   farver_2.1.2        memoise_2.0.1      \n[109] htmltools_0.5.8.1   R.oo_1.27.1         lifecycle_1.0.4    \n[112] httr_1.4.7          MASS_7.3-65"

    "section": "4.1 The Present Study",
    "text": "4.1 The Present Study\nIn the present study, I examined whether previous performance or previous opportunity is a stronger predictor of future performance among wide receivers. For the predictors, I operationalized a wide receiver’s performance using their receiving yards, obtained from the nflreadr package (Ho & Carl, 2024). I operationalized a wide receiver’s opportunity using their air yards, obtained from the nflreadr package (Ho & Carl, 2024). For the criterion, I examined wide receivers’ fantasy points in the subsequent game, calculated by Petersen (2025) using the ffanalytics package (Andersen, Petersen, & Tungate, 2025). Thus, I examined the wide receiver’s fantasy points and air yards in a given week in predicting their fantasy points in the subsequent week. Although fantasy points are the ultimate outcome, I examined air yards (opportunity) and receiving yards (performance) as a predictor to isolate the predictive utility of yardage-related receiving opportunity relative to yardage-related receiving production. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether previous performance or opportunity is a stronger predictor of future fantasy performance.\nI hypothesized that, due to natural variability from week-to-week that, in part, reflects randomness and is consistent with the statistical principle of regression to the mean, opportunity would be a stronger influence of subsequent performance than previous performance. If the hypothesis is true, I predict that air yards will be a stronger predictor, compared to actual receiving yards, in predicting future fantasy points. Testing this possibility is important for determining what factors may be used to best identify players who, despite not gaining many receiving yards in a given week, may do well in future weeks."

    "section": "5.1 Data",
    "text": "5.1 Data\nBelow, I load the data file used for this post. The data file includes weekly player statistics, including air yards, receiving yards, and fantasy points. I obtained the data file from the Open Science Framework repository for the textbook, “Fantasy Football Analytics: Statistics, Prediction, and Empiricism Using R” (Petersen, 2025).\n\n\nCode\nload(file = \"../../data/player_stats_weekly.RData\")\n\n\nFirst, I subset the data to Wide Receivers:\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- player_stats_weekly %&gt;% \n  filter(position_group == \"WR\")\n\n\nThe weekly data include all seasons since 1999 (i.e., currently 1999–2024):\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  arrange(season) %&gt;% \n  select(season) %&gt;% \n  pull() %&gt;% \n  unique()\n\n\n [1] 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n[16] 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\n\nSecond, to prepare the data for analysis, I created a lagged variable for fantasy points so that fantasy points in a subsequent year (e.g., 2024) are in the same row as player performance from the prior year (e.g., 2023). Creation of a lagged variable allowed using previous performance to predict future fantasy points.\nThe original data set includes only those rows for weeks in which a given player played. For instance, if a player played weeks 9 and 11 but missed week 10 due to injury, they would have rows for only week 9 and 11. However, this is a problem if we were to lag a variable (fantasy points) up a row because, in this instance, it would be lagging the variable two weeks (from week 11 to week 9), rather than one week. To ensure that the lagged variable lags only 1 week (and not more weeks), I added missing rows for the missing weeks for given player-season combinations, to ensure each player-season combination had all 18 weeks represented.\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- analysisData %&gt;%\n  group_by(player_id, season) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::complete(week = 1:18) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\nThen, I created the lagged variable for fantasy points. I lagged fantasy points within season, so week 1 data did not get lagged to the final week of the prior season.\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- analysisData %&gt;% \n  arrange(player_id, season, week) %&gt;% \n  group_by(player_id, season) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    fantasyPoints_lag = lead(fantasyPoints)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\nBelow, I verify that the lagging worked as expected:\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  select(player_id, player_display_name, season, week, fantasyPoints, fantasyPoints_lag)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nHere are descriptive statistics for the variables that are the focus of this article:\n\n\nCode\nmodelVars &lt;- c(\"receiving_air_yards\",\"receiving_yards\",\"fantasyPoints\",\"fantasyPoints_lag\")\n\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(all_of(modelVars)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(across(\n      everything(),\n      .fns = list(\n        n = ~ length(na.omit(.)),\n        missingness = ~ mean(is.na(.)) * 100,\n        M = ~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        SD = ~ sd(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        min = ~ min(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        max = ~ max(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        q10 = ~ quantile(., .10, na.rm = TRUE), # 10th quantile\n        q90 = ~ quantile(., .90, na.rm = TRUE), # 90th quantile\n        range = ~ max(., na.rm = TRUE) - min(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        IQR = ~ IQR(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        MAD = ~ mad(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        CV = ~ sd(., na.rm = TRUE) / mean(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        median = ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        pseudomedian = ~ DescTools::HodgesLehmann(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        mode = ~ petersenlab::Mode(., multipleModes = \"mean\"),\n        skewness = ~ psych::skew(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        kurtosis = ~ psych::kurtosi(., na.rm = TRUE)),\n      .names = \"{.col}.{.fn}\")) %&gt;%\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(\n      cols = everything(),\n      names_to = c(\"variable\",\"index\"),\n      names_sep = \"\\\\.\") %&gt;% \n    tidyr::pivot_wider(\n      names_from = index,\n      values_from = value)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe lagged variable of fantasy points has fewer observations than the original fantasy points variable because, as mentioned earlier, I lagged data within seasons; consequently, week 1 data were not lagged to the prior season and thus were not retained in the lagged variable.\nHere is a correlation matrix of the relevant variables:\n\n\nCode\npetersenlab::cor.table(analysisData[,modelVars])\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFigure 2 depicts a correlation matrix plot of the relevant variables.\n\n\nCode\nGGally::ggcorr(\n  analysisData[,modelVars],\n  label = TRUE,\n  label_round = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation Matrix Plot."

I first identified the best-fitting transformation for (lagged) fantasy points:\n\n\nCode\nbnTransformed &lt;- bestNormalize(analysisData$fantasyPoints_lag)\n\n\nHere are the transformation results—in this case, the best-fitting transformation is an ordered quantile (ORQ) normalization transformation:\n\n\nCode\nbnTransformed\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 52945 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower =&gt; more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 103.0858\n - Center+scale: 117.1422\n - Double Reversed Log_b(x+a): 134.474\n - Exp(x): 5460.6339\n - Log_b(x+a): 94.7922\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 91.3242\n - sqrt(x + a): 98.4754\n - Yeo-Johnson: 94.5148\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\norderNorm Transformation with 52945 nonmissing obs and ties\n - 820 unique values \n - Original quantiles:\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n-2.78  1.80  5.70 12.20 62.10 \n\n\nThen, I apply the best-fitting transformation to the variable, to create a transformed variable that is more normally distributed.\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData$fantasyPoints_lag_transformed &lt;- predict(bnTransformed)\n\n\nA histogram of raw fantasy points is in Figure 8.\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = analysisData,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = fantasyPoints_lag)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    color = \"#000000\",\n    fill = \"#0099F8\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Fantasy Points in a Week\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Histogram of Fantasy Points (Week)\",\n    subtitle = \"(Among Wide Receivers)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Histogram of Fantasy Points.\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram of the transformed variable is in Figure 9.\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = analysisData,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = fantasyPoints_lag_transformed)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    color = \"#000000\",\n    fill = \"#0099F8\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Fantasy Points (Transformed) in a Week\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Histogram of Fantasy Points (Transformed)\",\n    subtitle = \"(Among Wide Receivers)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Histogram of Fantasy Points (Transformed).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the regression model are below:\n\n\nCode\nregressionModelStandardized_transformed &lt;- lm(\n  formula = scale(fantasyPoints_lag_transformed) ~ scale(receiving_air_yards) + scale(receiving_yards),\n  data = analysisData\n)\n\nsummary(regressionModelStandardized_transformed)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = scale(fantasyPoints_lag_transformed) ~ scale(receiving_air_yards) + \n    scale(receiving_yards), data = analysisData)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-5.0650 -0.6185 -0.0283  0.5901  4.2404 \n\nCoefficients:\n                           Estimate Std.

    "text": "7.1 Strengths and Limitations\nThe study had several strengths. First, I examined data from all seasons since 1999, thus providing strong statistical power to detect differences in the strength of associations. Second, I conducted several sensitivity analyses, providing additional rigor in the methods and additional confidence in the findings.\nThe study also had limitations. First, air yards and other statistical indexes depend on many factors such as the game script and, in a given game, may not be representative of a player’s role in the offense. Second, a player’s inclusion of a given week in the analysis required the player to play in the given game and the following week. Player availability could depend, in part, due to usage; for instance, receivers who run more routes, receive more targets, and obtain more air/receiving yards could be more likely to miss a subsequent game due to injury and thus could be missing systematically from my analysis. This possibility would be important for future work to consider."

However, both previous performance and opportunity are important predictors of fantasy performance and should be considered when predicting wide receiver fantasy performance. Among underperforming players, air yards—as an index of opportunity—may be a useful way of identifying those who may bounce back in subsequent weeks."
